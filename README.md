Attempts at simple econ theory graphs using TikZ

Lots of material borrowed / adapted from:

Kevin Goulding https://thetarzan.wordpress.com/

Chiu Yu Ko https://kochiuyu.github.io/

Arnav Bandekar https://github.com/jackypacky/pgf-econ-graphs

I am attempting to use tikzmath calculations rather than hard-coding slopes, equilibrium points, etc.
